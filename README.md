# autoencoder
you need to create an autoencoder using pytorch.
the autoencoder will be made up of an encoding part and an unencoding part. we are going to encode the data and save the data in a .csv file so that it can be shared in an encrypted way, so that whoever has the unencoding part will receive the initially encoded data. this autoencoder will be made with CNNs.
For our work, we will use the pytorch MNIST file, which is an image file.
