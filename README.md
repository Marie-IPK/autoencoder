# autoencoder
you need to create an autoencoder using pytorch.
The autoencoder will consist of an encoder part and an unencoder part. We are going to encode the data and save the data in a .csv file so that it can be shared in an encrypted way, so that whoever has the unencoder part will receive the initially encoded data.
For our work, we will use the pytorch MNIST file, which is an image file.
